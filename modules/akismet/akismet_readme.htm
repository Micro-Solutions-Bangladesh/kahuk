<h3>Description</h3>
<p><a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a> is a hosted web service that saves you time by automatically detecting story and comment. Each time a new story or comment is added to your site it's submitted to the Akismet web service which runs hundreds of tests on the comment and returns a thumbs up or thumbs down. As a result, you don't have to waste your time sorting through and deleting spammy comments from your website.</p>
