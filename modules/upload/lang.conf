Uploaded images can have multiple thumbnails generated during the upload process. Should you ever want to change or add a thumbnail size, the upload module will generate the new thumbnail size for existing images in the database after submitting the new thumbnail size. When submitting this page in that circumstance it might take a while for it to reload because it has to process all existing images.</p><p>You can manually insert images into your post by entering the template tag provided after upload, or by copying that tag into your link_summary.tpl template and adding a $ after the curly bracket. An example of this would be 	<span class='label'>{$image1}</span>.</p>"
