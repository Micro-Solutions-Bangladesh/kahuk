<h2>Total Story Views</h2>

<h2>Description</h2>
<h3>The Total Story Views Module for Plikli allows you to:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Display, in ONE of thirteen (13) different places, the total views of each news article.</li>
<li>If the sidebar display is ON, it displays up to the number of articles set of the most viewed articles, by descending order, in the sidebar; the sidebar display default is 5.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Where to display the Total Views</h3>
<p>The default is set "story_total_views_custom", which means NO PLACE and you have to set a placement. The ideal placement is "tpl_plikli_story_tools_start", which is in the story tools, right before where the "Discuss     Add Bookmark    Group Share" are placed. (see the illustration on the module's settings page in the Dashboard section.)</p>
<p>You can change it to where you want it to appear by selecting from the 13 different hook places under "Where to display the Total Views:" on the settings page after you view the many snapshots I provided to illustrate the look and feel of each setting.</p>

<h3>Displaying the Most Viewed articles in the sidebar</h3>
<p>By default, the sidebar display is off. You can always turn it ON/OFF from the settings page, under "Sidebar is Off by default. If you want to display it, change the settings to ON:"</p>

<h3>Number of stories you would like to display in the sidebar?</h3>
<p>The default is 5, however you can set the number you want!</p>
