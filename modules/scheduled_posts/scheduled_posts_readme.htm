<h2>Scheduled Posts Module v1.0</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This module MUST be installed when you set to TRUE "Allow Scheduled Articles" in<br />Dashboard -> Settings -> Submit -> Allow Scheduled Articles.</p>
<h4>How it works?</h4>
<p>The module runs only once a day, to save queries and strain on the server. It runs whenever the Index (Published) page is accessed, and the process is as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>First, we check if the Allow_Scheduled is set to true in the dashboard, Submit Settings.</li>
	<li>If it is true, then we check, in the misc_data table, for the date the module last ran. If the value is empty or not equal to today's date, then the module will run</li>
	<li>If scheduled posts to be posted on the current date are found in the links table, the module calls a function to check whether the status of these posts should be set to Published or New and then it updates their status and adjusts the totals table accordingly.</li>
	<li>Updates the date value of "scheduled_run" in the misc_data table to the CURRENT date to prevent the module from keep running on that day.</li>
	<li>If no scheduled posts were found, it also updates the date value to prevent it from running again in the same day.</li>
	<li>If it is false, then we save the queries and the module won't run.</li>
</ul>
